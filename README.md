# AI-Chatbot-Project
The goals of this project was to understand the fundamental ideas behind machine learning and how to use the TensorFlow for Python API in order to create an AI Chatbot. Based off TechWithTim's youTube tutorial series on making an AI Chatbot, this chatbot can have an intelligent conversation with the user based upon the intents. As a result of these intents, you can adapt the Chatbot to whatever situation. NOTE: Most of the comments are centered around me trying to learn what each line of code, and so I wrote down my interpretation of that part of the code; TU in the comments are points for which I need to go back and understand further.
